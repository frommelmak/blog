## About me

I'm a Telecom engineer and Linux SysAdmin who loves solving problems. Like the old hackers, I really need to understand how things work, so I like learning new things every day. I'm passionate about technology in general but specially about all internet related stuff.

## About this blog

In 2005 I wanted to learn PHP so rather than using one of the popular blog engines available those days, I decided to write my own code to build my blog. 

Since those early days I've been using this blog to write some blog entries about technical challenges I deal with everyday. 

Nowadays I've replaced my beloved blog engine with a simple static site generator called [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) with no database and no server-side logic requirements.
The new blog uses the beautifull theme [Plumage](https://github.com/kdeldycke/plumage) by Kevin Deldycke. On the other hand the blog content is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frommelmak/blog).

All the technical entries have been migrated into the new blog but if you want, you can still visit the old blog [here](http://old.frommmelmak.com).
